Movie Ratings dataset, contains information on 559 movies with their Rotten Tomatoes ratings, genre, budget, among other variables.

We did a basic analysis of the relationship between these variables using R, and tidyverse.

Tidyverse is an R programming package that helps to transform and better present data.

It assists with data import, tidying, manipulation, and data visualization.

The ggplot2 package within tidyverse is used to create detailed graphics and graphical representations of data.
